# Select-Players
## Team-Based Tournament Player Selector Tool
### Created by Damon Murdoch 

## Description
Given a list of player names which should be selected for this week (in players.csv) and an (optional) number of players to select, selects the players from the list depending on who has played the least, and their win/loss ratio as a secondary sorting method. 

## Players.csv
The players.csv file should be placed in the same directory as the script itself. The Driftveil Dragapults (2021) 
player roster is contained within as an example. The file format is as follows:

Name, Wins, Loss, Available

Where the purpose of each column is as follows:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description                                              |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|Name         | String    | Name of the player                                       |
|Wins         | Int       | Number of wins the player has                            |
|Loss         | Int       | Number of losses the player has                          |
|Available    | Int       | 1 means they can be played, 0 means they are unavailable |
